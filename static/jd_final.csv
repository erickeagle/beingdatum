We take on big problems to help drivers, riders, delivery partners, and eaters get moving in more than 600 cities around the world.

We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let’s move the world forward, together.

About the Role

This position is in the India Maps team. Maps plays a foundational role in Uber; many of the core Uber product functions are built on top of or leverage Maps functionality directly or indirectly. India Maps team develops high-priority, critical pieces of functionality for the Maps organization, working on a variety of things from Routing observability, diagnostics, algorithmic map error detection, experiment simulation platform, basemap data platform to Uber Places platform, Legoland, etc.

This position falls in the Routing vertical of the Maps organization. The Maps Routing stack in Uber is a set of technologies that produces the best route from point A to point B and estimates time (ETAs) for all Uber. This includes modeling traffic on roads from GPS locations, sophisticated routing algorithms with a variety of cost functions, turn-by-turn navigation experience, and machine-learned ETAs predictions. This also requires building big data pipelines -- both batch and real-time -- to process and ingest map data, computing ETAs, traffic, etc. Our routing solutions powers many Uber products ranging from pickup ETAs, driver-rider matching (Uber Pool and others), fare estimation, EATs, Freight, Bicycles and more to come!

This role is critical to our Maps product as a whole -- when map data does not reflect the real world accurately, all the services built on top of it are adversely affected causing degradation of customer experience and safety issues. As the real world keeps changing, any map, regardless of initial quality, will always have errors; and the ability to apply ML and algorithms to detect and fix map errors is one of the most scalable ways for us to keep the maps accurate.
What You’ll Do
For this job position, we are looking for a strong ML engineer who can solve challenges in Maps domain by applying ML techniques. The particular problem that this engineer will work on is to automatically detect many kinds of errors in our global map data by leveraging the huge amount of signals that is available at Uber (ex: terabytes of GPS traces, re-routes, traffic patterns, customer tickets, satellite/streetside imagery, etc). This problem is made even more challenging given that we need to detect these errors with high precision (to minimize costs of manual review) and high recall (to detect most of the significant errors present in the map).

A successful Maps ML engineer would have
6 years of experience with Machine Learning, Software Engineering in a highly competitive environment
Ability to translate a real-life problem into a ML model (deep learning, decision trees, bayesian models, etc)
Practical knowledge of feature engineering, model training, model tuning, model evaluation, etc.
Experience with designing a scalable ML System including feature store, training pipeline, model serving, model deployment, experimentation framework
Demonstrated application of ML techniques in the industry for a problem at scale with fruitful results.
Experience using machine learning libraries or platforms such as Tensorflow, Caffe, Theano, Scikit-Learn, Spark ML, etc.
Some knowledge of backend software engineering including coding and working with scalable software services and systems.
Bonus points for Geospatial experience: Familiarity with geospatial datasets and services, such as maps, local search, points of interest and business listings data, mobile device location and GPS traces would be a plus but is not required.

Why join us
Truly unique set of problems: The nature of Uber’s business imposes a distinct set of constraints on Maps that cannot be found elsewhere.
Teammates: Work with empathetic, smart and motivated teammates in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.
Impact: Mapping is central to Uber’s success. You’ll be working on mission critical projects that are visible both inside and outside of Uber. The map error detection project is a key project in the Mapping org and has high visibility and impact.
High scalability engineering: Build world class engineering for high throughput and low latency distributed systems. We take ownership in creating elegant and reliable code.
Fun problem solving: We love solving challenging problems with cutting edge algorithms. We move fast and build things that have never been built before."

We are on a mission to expedite the AI-age by providing critical tooling infrastructure for engineers to build high accuracy AI models. Our first product is providing high-quality annotations-as-a-service for Autonomous AI (self-driving cars, drones, industrial robots). We're backed by YCombinator, SAIF Partners & Google Launchpad. In the last 18 months, we've established ourselves as a market leader created 200M+ annotations, grown 12X in top line, acquired 50+ enterprise customers across 10+ countries including Didi, Daimler, Ford, Samsung etc.

Why is it important?


High-quality training data is essential to improve the quality of ML algorithms. Forbes estimates ML engineers spent 70% of their time in pre/post processing & data management steps. Companies need to build sophisticated tooling (supporting all forms of sensor data), hire and manage hundreds of skilled people to ensure high quality labeled data. Our autonomous driving customers estimate 1 hour of video data needs 800 man-hours of manual human work. Today, at the wake of autonomous car industry only few million kms of data has been labeled and 10x more will be collected before the world sees them on road. Like DevOps is critical to tech implementation, MLOps will be a big challenge as ML development commercialises in the next 5-10 years. We aim to become an ML data platform, a critical part of ML infrastructure stack.

Join us to witness & influence the unfolding of AI, which is the largest technology wave the world will ever see.

Designation : Junior data scientist
Qualification : No specific requirements.
Experience : Minimum 2 years of experience as hands-on data scientist
Insight Jedi is hiring a Machine Learning expert.

What do we do?
There are a lot of companies that do machine learning. Lots of companies also build tools to manage and deploy machine learning models. But most of the “learning” part of machine learning is still human driven. Once a problem is posed, everything -- data cleanup, feature engineering, model building -- is still mostly done manually by data scientists. There are no tools that help domain experts e.g. business users or analysts, to do all these things automatically -- one would still need to know enough coding and statistics to make them work.
We started thinking about this problem a few years back. A couple of years back we finally were able to build a platform that automates everything -- users just bring their data, answer a few questions, and get very accurate predictive models in minutes or hours, not weeks and months -- completely automatically! The platform doesn’t care where the data came from or how the data looks like.
Insight Jedi’s ability to build models completely automatically has enabled us to solve some of the toughest business problems -- across multiple domains. Our platform has been able to predict which cell phone towers are about to fail for a large European tele-communications company; it was able to measure the impact of delivery delays in logistics to buying patterns of customers from transactions for a well known e-commerce company -- connecting for the first time, the data in two silos; it has drastically improved collections for healthcare companies by model-driven prioritizations; it has automatically alerted of anomalous patterns from almost a million metrics being tracked by one of the largest global CPG companies, helping them address issues months before they would have identified.
*
How can we work together?
On any given day, we spend our time doing lots of things. If you join our team, you will be working with us on each of these. We have made a ton of progress building this platform from the ground-up, and have had actual impact on our client’s businesses. But there’s a lot to be done.
Large part of our job is to understand the scale of automation needed to convert a complex but pretty generic business problem to a collection of algorithms working in tandem. As an example, when we are automatically surfacing anomalies for hundreds of time-series metrics, we are not doing just that. We are automating extracting anomalies from any time series data, we are automating finding patterns in anomalies, and we are automating what to say about the future by looking at patterns in anomalies. You will be contributing in combining otherwise isolated algorithms to deliver automated solutions.
As an expert, you have read, implemented or devised lots of algorithms. But a lot of these algorithms never see real life since the path to automating it to a large number of real-world problems is not obvious. Our key premise -- that everything including feature engineering, model selection, model estimation will be automated -- and, our repeated interactions of real-life problems from our clients -- gives us an open playground to bring large scale adoption of all these algorithms. You will help in bringing these algorithms to “life”.
We design our own algorithms using any mathematical building blocks e.g. EM and variational methods, Bayesian models and appropriate priors, Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, regularisation, gradient descent, matrix factorisation, etc. We have a good understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory to understand academic research papers in statistics, machine learning, and computer science. It is expected that you have some formal training in this.
We code, write tests, tune for speed and memory consumption, and finally, document and deploy algorithms to production. We code in python (and Cython), but if you are proficient in at least one language, we are confident that you will be able to contribute to our production code.
We scale algorithms to large datasets in way shorter time by designing them from scratch. It might even mean certain tradeoffs and understanding of computing e.g. making use of embarrassingly parallel methods, map-reduce frameworks, or tricks of linear algebra, etc. Knowledge of algorithmic and computing fundamentals which allow scaling will be favorable.
Location:
We are OK with remote work, at least initially, although we expect familiarity with tools like github to make remote work more efficient.

What will you be working on?
Insight Jedi builds custom applications on the platform which solve some of the hardest business problems for our clients. Your responsibility will be to understand the business problem and use the platform components to automate the complete data science workflow for the problem. Our deliverable to our clients is an application which just ingests data and automatically builds models, throws insights as visualisations, and even auto-update the model when new data comes in. You will be responsible for everything in the backend that does this. This includes:
Framing the business problem as the most appropriate machine learning problem.
Incorporating platform components to build what we call a custom recipe. We have a well-maintained but complex and large code-base -- you will be understanding how each component is related with others. Custom recipes almost always have multiple sources of data coming in -- you will be structuring the data such that the automated feature engineering and filtering engines can take over (it is called the Signal Factory in Insight Jedi).
Building insights from the model and the data which answers all the big and small questions which define the business problem. Insights are typically outputs of predictive models, small standalone statistical models, or just data being shown in specific ways.
Contribute to developing core algorithms of the Insight Jedi platform.
Help the rest of the team to respond to customer requests for support, or questions on how things work and why.
What will you bring in?
You will have good knowledge of python.
You will have a basic understanding of machine learning algorithms.
You will have strong communication skills to understand what needs to be done, ask questions to flesh out ideas, and even document work when needed.

This job opening is for a Solutions Architect role within the public sector team of Amazon Internet Services Private Limited (AISPL), India. We work with the central government ministries, state and local governments, public sector units, education institutions, EdTech startups including India-based Unicorns, nonprofits, and healthcare. Our vision is to help public institutions in India to make a significant impact to the lives of citizens, by taking a technology generation leap through use of AWS cloud services within the domains of Skilling, Smart Infrastructure, Healthcare and Inclusion (Physical, Digital and Financial).

We are known for our unwavering customer obsession. Our solutions architecture teams are on the front line of helping customers succeed using AWS technologies. Our team members leverage their deep knowledge of AWS technologies in collaboration with our sales and partner teams to impact how solutions are proposed, architected and implemented for clients. Helping make customer success a reality and seeing the impact in real-time drives our teams to explore new frontiers in leveraging AWS cloud for both commercial and public sector organizations.
